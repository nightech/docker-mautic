1.2. How to install fcron

1.2.1. Compilation requirements

     * A C compiler (e.g. gcc)
     * (optional) readline development library (e.g. libreadline-dev)
     * (optional) PAM development library (e.g. libpam0g-dev)
     * (optional) SE Linux development library (e.g. libselinux1-dev)
     * (optional) Linux audit development library (e.g. libaudit-dev)
     * If compiling from git checkout (rather than a tarball), then no
       generated file will be included out of the box, so you will need
       more tools to generate them. In particular the ./configure script
       and the documentation will be generated from the sources.
          + git
          + autoconf
          + docbook
          + docbook-xsl
          + docbook-xml
          + docbook-util
          + manpages-dev

1.2.2. Compilation and installation instructions

     * uncompress the archive:

       bash$ tar -xzf fcron-X.Y.Z.src.tar.gz

     * cd to the archive directory

       bash$ cd fcron-X.Y.Z

     * run the configure script:

       bash$./configure

          + If you can't see a ./configure, then you probably checked out
            the files from git, in which case you need to run autoconf to
            generate the configure script.
          + If using PAM, beware that by default the PAM configuration
            will be installed in /usr/local/etc/. That most likely mean
            that your system won't use this config, and may ask you to
            type your password everytime you start fcrontab or fcrondyn.
            The simplest way to avoid this is to instruct configure to use
            /etc instead with:

            bash$ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc

          + You may also want to change the place where fcron will be
            installed: you can use the configure 's option --prefix to do
            that. For instance:

            bash$ ./configure --prefix=/usr--sysconfdir=/etc

            (default is prefix=/usr/local and sysconfdir=${prefix}/etc).
          + To disable the use of PAM, SE Linux or fcrondyn, use
            configure's option --with-pam=no, --with-selinux=no and/or
            --with-fcrondyn=no.
          + The command make install asks you by default some questions
            you have to answer. To avoid that (which can be useful for
            automatic installers), you can use the ./configure's option
            --with-answer-all and/or --with-boot-install (see "./configure
            --help" for more details).
          + To debug fcron, you should use configure 's option
            --with-debug.
          + You can get info on the others configure 's options by running
            "./configure --help".

                                    Warning
         + The configure script may not define a correct directory for
           the man pages and the documentation on some systems. You may
           check the values defined by configure and if necessary force a
           value by the options --mandir and -with-docdir (see the help
           by running "./configure --help").
         + If you get older fcron's man-pages with man command after
           having upgraded, it's probably because fcron has changed its
           default man directory: you should remove manually the outdated
           man-pages.
         + The Makefile has been designed for GNU make. Some other
           version of make may fail to use it.

     * (optional) check the file config.h, and change it if necessary (the
       configurable part is on the top of the file and clearly delimited).
     * compile:

       bash$ make

     * then install binaries as root:

       bash$ su root

       bash# make install

   You can now run fcron and fcrontab.

     * This is a POSIX conforming software. You must have a POSIX compiler
       (gcc for example) in order to compile it.
     * This software has been written for GNU/Linux systems. If you want
       to port it on an other Unix platform (thank you if you do it), try
       to modify - if possible - only the configure script. Please send me
       any modifications at <fcron@free.fr> in order to include it in
       future releases.
